# Consistency

## Use simple language

Use consistent language and terminology throughout the design to ensure clarity and understanding for users.

Use simple and clear language, following the principles of the UK government's Content Design guidance (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design), to ensure that content is accessible and easy to understand for all users. \[[Using simple and clear language](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design)]

## Reuse existing styles and patterns

Implement a common style-guide and frontend framework across services \[how to document styles, how to choose a front end framework]

Use patterns provided with the building blocks, unless research clearly indicates a need to diverge from them.

Use a consistent style guide, if your organisation has one, to ensure consistency in visual elements, typography, colour schemes, and other design elements.

## Document and share design decisions

Share research findings and product progress with team members, senior members or strategic leaders, and even the general public whenever practical. \[resource on design documentation/sharing with teams]
