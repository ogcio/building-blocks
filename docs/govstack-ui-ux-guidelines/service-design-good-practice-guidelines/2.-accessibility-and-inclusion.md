# Accessibility and inclusion

## Test for accessibility

Check that the implementation of the building blocks, as well as the overall digital government service, meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards for accessibility. \[[WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/)]

Test the service using accessibility tools like screen readers to identify and fix any accessibility issues. \[[How to test for accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility) ]

Stay informed about any updates or changes to accessibility standards, guidelines, and inclusivity best practices.

Regularly review and update the implementation of the building blocks and the digital government service to ensure continued accessibility and inclusivity compliance.

Seek expert assistance or consultation on accessibility and inclusivity if needed.

## Test your service with diverse users

Consider principles of inclusivity, such as Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) guidelines where applicable, and ensure that all interactive elements and components used in the service, including those based on the building blocks, are designed and tested to be inclusive, respectful, and representative of diverse user groups. \[[Universal barriers to access](https://uteschauberger.com/barrierstoaccess.html)] \[[GESI guidelines](https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/gender\_and\_social\_inclusion\_guide.pdf)]

## Involve users in the design

Involve users with disabilities and users from diverse backgrounds in user testing and feedback gathering to identify any potential accessibility and inclusivity issues.

Foster a culture of inclusivity within the team and encourage ongoing education and awareness on inclusivity and diversity best practices. \[resource on co-design]
