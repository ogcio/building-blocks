# 3.1.3.1 Share findings

Share research findings with team members, senior members or strategic leaders, and even the general public whenever practical.&#x20;

The aim is not just to share information but also to generate dialogue and collaborative action based on the findings.

**Organise Your Findings**&#x20;

Begin by grouping your user insights, key takeaways, and suggestions. This could be grouped by themes, user groups, and stages in the user journey.

**Create a Simple Presentation**

Document your findings. Each slide could represent a key finding or insight. Remember to use clear, simple language and include visual aids where possible to increase understanding.

**Schedule a Playback Session**

Invite team members and stakeholders to a meeting where you'll share your findings. Make time for discussion.

&#x20;**Document and Share**

Share the presentation along with any additional notes from the discussion. This ensures that everyone has access to the information and can refer back to it in the future.&#x20;

You might even consider publishing findings openly through a blog or similar format.
