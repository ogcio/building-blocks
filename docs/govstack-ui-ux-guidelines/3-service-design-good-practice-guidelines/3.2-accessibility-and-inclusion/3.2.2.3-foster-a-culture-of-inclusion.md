### **Everyone benefits**&#x20;

Accessible design isn't just for users with disabilities - it enhances usability for all users. Simple features like captions or clear language can help everyone.

### **Temporary/situational disabilities**&#x20;

Accessibility isn't just about permanent disabilities. Users may experience temporary or situational impairments, like a broken arm or a bright environment, where accessibility features can improve their experience.

### **Ageing population**&#x20;

Accessible design is particularly important for older adults who may experience changes in vision, hearing, and motor skills. Designing with accessibility in mind ensures your service is user-friendly for all age groups.

### **Legal/ethical duty**&#x20;

In many places, accessibility is not just an ethical duty but also legally required. Providing accessible services ensures everyone can use your service, regardless of their abilities.

### **Future-proofing**&#x20;

Accessible design often results in more robust and flexible services. By prioritising accessibility, you make your service more resilient to future changes and adaptable to different technologies or platforms.

### **Overhead cost**&#x20;

Incorporating accessibility from the start of the design process is efficient. Retrofitting accessibility features later can be more time-consuming and costly. Make accessibility a foundational part of your design process, not an afterthought.
