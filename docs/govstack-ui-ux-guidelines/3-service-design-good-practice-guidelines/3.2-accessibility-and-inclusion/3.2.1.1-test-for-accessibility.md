# 3.2.1.1 Test for accessibility

### **Check WCAG Compliance**

Make sure that the implementation of the Building Blocks and the overall digital government service meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards for accessibility.&#x20;

WCAG provides a set of internationally recognised guidelines for creating accessible web content. Familiarise yourself with the guidelines to ensure your service meets the necessary accessibility requirements.

### **Test with Accessibility Tools**

Test the service using accessibility tools to identify and address any accessibility issues. These tools help simulate the experience of users with disabilities and uncover potential barriers.&#x20;

Consider using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and colour contrast checkers, among other tools, to ensure your service is accessible to all users.
