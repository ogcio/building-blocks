# 3.4.1.2 Design for privacy

Make sure citizensâ€™ rights are protected by integrating privacy as an essential part of your system.

1. Define the data you need to collect for your service.
2. Use the Privacy by Design framework to integrate privacy controls into your system.
3. Create a transparent privacy policy that outlines what data you collect, why you collect it, and how it's used and stored. You can use the [privacy policy design pattern](https://govstack.gitbook.io/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/Xygp83qW0E147CCaqsI0/\~/changes/87/service-patterns/design-patterns/privacy-policy).
4. Ensure compliance with any applicable data security and privacy protection laws.
5. [Refer to GovStack's security and privacy guidelines document (ISO27K compliance)](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/security-requirements)
