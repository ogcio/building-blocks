# Test across platforms

Test the service, verifying its compatibility with different devices, browsers, and assistive technologies

1. Identify the range of devices, operating systems, and browsers your users may use.
2. Use testing tools like [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/?utm\_source=google\&utm\_medium=cpc\&utm\_platform=paidads\&utm\_content=434390274186\&utm\_campaign=Search-Brand-Tier1-EMEA-CL\&utm\_campaigncode=BrowserStack-Alpha+9045064\&utm\_term=e+browser%20stack\&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1\_SkBhDwARIsANbGpFuHZKpVfWZcvwZijeKuyLTx-ZRTO0avBD9GCegZKgImzQXOYbtMa3QaArBSEALw\_wcB) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) to test your service on these platforms.
3. Make necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility across platforms.
4. Continuously test new versions of your service on these platforms.
