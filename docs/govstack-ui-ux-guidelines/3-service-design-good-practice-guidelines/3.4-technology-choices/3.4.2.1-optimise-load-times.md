# 3.4.2.1 Optimise load times

In many contexts where GovStack Building Blocks are being used, internet bandwidth may be slow, therefore it is essential to optimise load times and minimal data transfer.&#x20;

1. Use [Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) to test your web application's performance.
2. Identify areas for improvement based on the test results.
3. Implement improvements such as using compressed images, optimising front-end code, leveraging CDNs, etc.
4. Retest and continue to optimise as needed.
5. From a design perspective, only use necessary images, optimise images for the web, use CSS and SVG instead of images where possible, minimise the use of different font families, and optimise font loading if custom fonts are used.
6. Use AJAX/Fetch mechanisms for asynchronous and partial updates of the UI.
