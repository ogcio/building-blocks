# 3.3.2.2 Use design patterns

### **GovStack Patterns - A Strong Foundation**

GovStack offers a robust set of well-tested patterns for common user journeys. These can serve as a foundational structure for your services, presenting an outline for the necessary pages within your user journey and providing guidance for the content on each page.

### **Beyond Coded Components**

While these patterns offer a solid starting point, it is important to note that they do not provide coded or designed components. For implementing these aspects, refer back to our guidance on setting up a front-end framework.

### **Consistency and Testing**

Whether employing GovStack patterns or creating your own, maintaining consistency across your government services is key. After establishing your patterns, make sure to test the end result with users. This will ensure that your service is not only consistent but also user-friendly and effective.
