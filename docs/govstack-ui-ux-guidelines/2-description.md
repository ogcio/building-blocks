  Design standards, guidance, and patterns for designing services using GovStack
  Building Blocks.

# 2 Description

This document has been developed as guidance to kick-start the design and development of services that use and combine GovStack applications and Building Blocks, as well as other components while maintaining a seamless and consistent user experience.

This guidance supports teams in identifying and implementing the foundations for designing user-centered, accessible, consistent, and technically robust services. Intended to help teams align to the [GovStack Design Principles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/govstack-design-principles) and the [Implementation Playbook](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/).

## 2.1 Current scope

Specifications for how to implement accessible, responsive, multi-modal Building Blocks and provide a consistent service.

* Guidelines for designing interfaces (like meeting [WCAG accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)).
* Screen flows for common user journeys (like registration).
* Guidance on technical choices (like how to design for low bandwidth, high latency environments, unreliable connectivity, local storage, local persistence of data security using DOMs, etc.).
* Patterns for managing client-side validation.

## 2.2 Good practice UI/UX guidelines for Service Design&#x20;

The guidelines act as a template checklist for assuring the quality of a service's design and delivery. Each point in the guideline has/links to additional guidance.

## 2.3 Service patterns

We chose to define high-level service patterns rather than anything more specific like a design system or user interface components, this is to maintain flexibility to work around each organization's needs and existing design assets and front-end frameworks.
