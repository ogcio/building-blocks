## **How it Works**

### **Invitation for Feedback**&#x20;

Invite users to provide feedback about their overall experience with the service catalogue. This could be a dedicated page, a pop-up prompt, or an email sent after a certain period of usage.

### **Survey Form**&#x20;

Create a form to collect user perceptions about the entire service catalogue. Use a mix of open-ended questions and structured items (like ratings or multiple-choice questions) to gather comprehensive feedback.

#### **Submit Button**&#x20;

Include a clear call-to-action button for submitting the survey. A label like "Submit survey" is straightforward and effective.

#### **Success Confirmation**&#x20;

After users submit their survey responses, show a success message to confirm receipt. Something simple like "Thank you, your survey has been submitted" works well.

### **Data you might collect**

In addition to feedback about specific services, consider collecting:

* **User ID:** If the user is logged in, this can help provide context for the feedback.
* **Overall Satisfaction:** Ask users to rate their overall satisfaction with the service catalogue.
* **Specific Services Used:** Understanding which services a user has interacted with can provide context for their feedback.
* **Timestamp:** Recording when the feedback was provided can help identify any time-related trends.
* **Suggestions for Improvement:** Ask users what they think could improve their experience with the service catalogue.

### **Potential Questions for User Survey**

To gain a deeper understanding of user experience with the government service catalogue, consider including these questions in your feedback form:

* **How did you find out about the government service catalogue?** This can give insights into the effectiveness of your outreach and communication strategies.
* **Which services have you used?** Knowing which specific services a user has interacted with can provide important context for their feedback.
* **How easy was it to find the services you needed?** This can shed light on the effectiveness of your catalogue layout and search functionality.
* **How would you rate your overall experience with the services you used?** This gives a high-level view of user satisfaction with your service offerings.
* **What improvements would you suggest for the services you used?** This open-ended question allows users to provide specific feedback and suggestions for individual services.
* **What additional services or features would you like to see in the future?** This can help guide your future development efforts based on user needs and wants.

## **When to Use this Pattern**&#x20;

This pattern is useful when you want to gather feedback on the overall service catalogue, rather than individual services or interactions. This can help identify strengths and weaknesses across your offerings and improve the user experience at the catalogue level.

## **When Not to Use this Pattern**&#x20;

Do not use this pattern as a substitute for gathering feedback on individual services or interactions. Users' experiences with specific services can be different from their overall impression of the service catalogue, so both types of feedback are valuable.
