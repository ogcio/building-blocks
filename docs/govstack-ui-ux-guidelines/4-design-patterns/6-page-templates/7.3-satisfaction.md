## **How it Works**

### **Satisfaction Survey**

At the end point of the user journey, prompt users to rate their experience. This should be a simple rating scale (1-5) or a binary satisfied/dissatisfied question.

### **Open-ended Feedback**

Following the rating, provide a text field for users to share more details about their experience. Prompt users with an open-ended question like, "How could we improve your experience?"

### **Submit Button**

Include a clear 'submit' button to finalise their feedback.

### **Success Message**

Display a success message after submission, thanking them for their feedback.

### **Data you might Collect**

* **User Satisfaction Score:** The user's response to the satisfaction rating question.
* **Feedback Text:** The user's response to the open-ended feedback question.
* **Page URL:** The URL of the page from which the feedback was submitted.
* **Session ID:** Identifies the particular user session, for associating feedback with specific user journeys.

### **Potential Questions for User Survey**

Consider adding questions to your satisfaction survey to gain deeper insights:

* **Did you accomplish what you intended to do in this session?** Helps understand if the user journey was effective and efficient

## **When to use this pattern**

Use this pattern at the end of a user journey to collect valuable feedback about user experiences. Be aware that user satisfaction is biased to users that reach an end-point of a service.
