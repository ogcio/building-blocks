## How it works

This page focuses the user's attention on what they need to complete the service in one go. You might list the documents or evidence required or emphasise certain eligibility criteria (e.g., age).

## **When to use this pattern**

When there is a risk that there is more information on a start page than users are likely to read you can break the 'before you start' information onto its own page.
