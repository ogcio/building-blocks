## **Considerations for choosing different patterns**

### **Step-by-step guide to help you pick the right patterns for your service:**

* [Identify Service Needs](../3-service-design-good-practice-guidelines/3.1-user-centred-design/): use the [GovStack playbook](https://app.gitbook.com/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/govstack-implementation-playbook/adopt-govstack/design-and-delivery/user-journeys) to understand the key interactions in your service.
* Map the user journey: Break down the user journey into phases like registration, information collection, appointments, feedback, and messaging. Identify the steps users take in each flow. [Consider the technology choices available to you](../3-service-design-good-practice-guidelines/3.4-technology-choices/).
* Choose user flows: Identify the patterns (task-focused page types) needed for each part of your user journey.
* Select page templates: User flow patterns often include several page templates. Start with existing patterns for user flows. For unique requirements, you may need to mix and match individual templates.
