# 7 Standards

The following standards are applicable to all aspects of the security building block and cross-cutting across other building blocks. Note that these are not technical standards but the process framework standards that shall be used to guide security decisions on the project::

* All of the implementation processes and guidance MUST follow the NIST CyberSecurity Framework (see [Ref 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9jS0BnfTM3azBED5349uD5sQ9VYYo8p/edit#heading=h.k32er9gmkfp0))
* All of the security issues and concerns to be addressed are related by number to the core requirements above. The detailed definitions can be found in the document entitled Digital Platform Security for GIZ, ITU DIAL GovStack (see [Ref 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9jS0BnfTM3azBED5349uD5sQ9VYYo8p/edit#heading=h.k32er9gmkfp0))
* It is assumed that the maximum level of information security required is what is known as CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information). Processes dealing with CUI must conform with NIST SP 900-171 Rev.2 (see [Ref 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9jS0BnfTM3azBED5349uD5sQ9VYYo8p/edit#heading=h.k32er9gmkfp0))&#x20;
