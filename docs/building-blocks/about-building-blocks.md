# About Building Blocks

**Building blocks** (BBs) are software modules that can be deployed and combined in a standardized manner. Each building block is capable of working independently, but they can be combined to do much more.

Building blocks are composable, interoperable software modules that can be used across a variety of use cases. They are standards-based, preferably open-source, and designed for scale.

Each building block exposes a set of services in the form of REST APIs that can be consumed by other building blocks or applications.

Please browse the building blocks that are specified in this release in the menu to the left.
