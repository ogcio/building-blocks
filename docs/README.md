# GovStack

The GovStack initiative aims to build a common understanding and technical practice on fundamental reusable and interoperable digital components, which we collectively refer to as Building Blocks. Our effort is expert-driven and community-based, and includes the participation of multiple stakeholders to bring together expertise for strengthening a government's cross-agency architecture view.&#x20;

Our focus is to enable countries to kickstart their digital transformation journey by adopting, deploying, and scaling digital government services. Through the digital "building blocks" approach, governments can easily create or modify their digital platforms, services, and applications by also simplifying cost, time, and resource requirements.
