# 23Q4

Publication date: December 6th, 2023

#### Overall Highlights

The GovStack initiative is proud to announce the release of the 23Q4 publication! Since the 1.0 publication in May 2023, the community has worked hard to add a substantial amount of new content, including 3 Building Blocks, 10 Reference Use Cases, UI/UX Guidelines, and a pre-release of the GovStack Sandbox documentation. These new additions allow us to continue progressing towards our goal of providing a common set of reference use cases, technical building blocks, and associated tools to accelerate and improve digital system design and implementation.

This publication was made possible by dozens of people, many of whom are volunteers, who were willing to share their expertise and time towards helping to build GovStack. The proficiency and diversity of this group of contributors strengthens the value of this work and we are extremely thankful for their involvement.

[**E-Signature Building Block**](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-esignature/v/sig-23q4)

[**Geographic Information System Building Block**](https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-gis/v/gis-23q4/)

The Geographic Information Services (GIS) Building Block enables various applications with location-based capabilities.
